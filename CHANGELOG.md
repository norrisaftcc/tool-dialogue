## Project Origins
The Retro Terminal Dialogue System began as a simple project to create a Twine alternative that didn't require external tools. The core concept was to build a JSON-based dialogue system with an 80s terminal aesthetic that evoked nostalgic text adventures while providing modern functionality.

The project evolved from a basic text display to include:
- Interactive dialogue choices
- Quest tracking system
- Typewriter text effects
- Dialogue editing capabilities
- Standardized dialogue format

The system maintains its focus on the retro terminal experience while continuously improving its capabilities for narrative designers and developers.
