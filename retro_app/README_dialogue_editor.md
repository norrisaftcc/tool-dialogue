I'd be happy to create a dialogue editor that matches the aesthetic of your terminal simulator! This editor will allow you to create and modify dialogue trees with a similar retro terminal look. Let's build a companion app to help you create and edit JSON dialogue files for your simulator.

Here's my implementation of a dialogue editor:

Now I've created a dedicated dialogue editor application that matches the retro terminal aesthetic of your simulator. This editor will help you create and modify dialogue JSON files easily.

Here's an overview of the key features:

1. **Retro Terminal Interface**: The editor has the same green-on-black aesthetic as your simulator.

2. **Complete Dialogue Management**:
   - Create, edit, and delete dialogues and responses
   - Add and manage quest information
   - Validate dialogue structure to catch errors

3. **File Operations**:
   - Load and save JSON files
   - Import and export dialogues
   - Reset to default template

4. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - View the dialogue tree structure
   - See statistics about your dialogue
   - Check for errors and warnings

5. **Raw JSON Editing**: Directly edit the JSON if you prefer

The editor is organized into four main tabs:

1. **DIALOGUES**: Add and edit dialogue nodes, NPC text, and player responses
2. **QUESTS**: Manage quest information, stages, and journal entries
3. **PREVIEW**: See the dialogue tree structure and statistics
4. **RAW JSON**: Edit the JSON data directly

To use the dialogue editor:

1. Save the file as `dialogue_editor.py`
2. Run it with `streamlit run dialogue_editor.py`
3. Create your dialogue content with the editor
4. Save it as `dialogue_data.json` (or another name)
5. Load the JSON in your terminal simulator

The editor includes validation to help you catch problems like missing dialogue IDs, duplicate IDs, or references to non-existent dialogues.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the editor in more detail, or would you like to see any additional features added?
